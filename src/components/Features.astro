    title: "Rich Widget Ingredients",
    icon: "🎨",
    description: "Everything you need to craft professional TUIs: charts, sparklines, tables, gauges, scrollable lists, trees, progress bars, and more. Mix and match widgets to create dashboards, monitoring tools, interactive forms, or full-featured command-line applications. Check out the widget examples to see what's possible."

    description: "Constraint-based responsive layouts that automatically adapt to any terminal size—think Flexbox, but for the terminal. Build complex nested layouts with horizontal and vertical splits, automatically sized containers, and percentage-based constraints. Your interface looks great whether it's in a tiny tmux pane or a 4K terminal."

  {
    title: "Pure Rust Reliability",
    icon: "🦀",
    description: "Memory-safe, thread-safe, and type-safe by design. No C dependencies, no runtime exceptions, no undefined behavior. Just pure Rust goodness that compiles to efficient native code. Works seamlessly with Crossterm, Termion, or Termwiz backends—choose the one that fits your needs."
